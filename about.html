                    <p>The concept of Young Futures is potential being placed in a supportive environment which allows the minds to flourish!</p>
                    <p>Young Futures was created to give the community an additional resource that was tailored to the needs of those seeking specific services. One of our initial programs allowed us to work with families from various backgrounds. James Mitchell was working with families in his own community. Providing childcare, mentorship, and social skill coaching. James decided he wanted to provide services to the different families that everyone could benefit but didn’t take any more time. A program that integrates the children and families was developed, James Mitchell as Young Futures coordinated visits with the different families and took the children on outings, that allowed them to observe a new environment that would grow them as an individual.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Families that total income was under 48,000 and had two or more dependents had the option of their children being able to participant in an entertaining, educational, or dining outing </li>
                    <li>Families with an income of over 95,000 and had two or fewer children had the option to allow their children to the participant with social, and educational outings</li>
                </ul>
            <p>James took children to places like Mass MoMa, Bronx Zoo, Boston Aquarium, Movies, Funplex, Park Trip, and Carnivals.</p>

                    <p>“Young Futures will emerge in our community with the intent to make a positive impact for those served, and generations that follow.”</p>

                    <p>As the State and city prepared for Hurricane Sandy I decided no matter how bad the community suffered that I would be allied to those that would lose resources. I started a Coat Drive for Adult’s and as the city was hit by heavy winds I passed out coats in my community. Driving around Delaware ave I meet several people that were new to this country. Through that winter I developed a relationship with different organizations like Mission Accomplished, while at A.C.A.P. I was also able to develop a partnership with an organization like S.N.U.G., then Albany Cure Violence.
                        On Tuesday and Thursday from February - April, the community adults were able to pick up a gently worn winter coat. Young Futures was able to develop a relationship with S.N.U.G. and the South End Community Center, which allowed us to give over 200 coats of the course of 3 Winter’s in the Capital District.</p>

                 <li class="answer">
                    <p>As the year began Young Futures realized that there were not many places for young men and women to you get Professional Wear. During that season we were able to giveaway dress shirts, and belt to men that were already enrolled in career services programs. We targeted the young professional that wanted to have an alternative outfit if give a job or second interview.
                    </p>Thanks to a partnership with Mission Accomplished we were able to provide them with over 30 gentle used suits. This helped the suit drive build awareness, and different partnerships.  The effects of this program are still being seen in our community, either by seeing a coat giving away years ago still in good condition, or bumping into an individual served in the community or workplace. <p>After spending the spring doing outreach and engagement Young Futures developed a partnership with Mission Accomplished.</p> <p> On August 26th, 2018 we supported  Mission Accomplished with it’s a recent Satisfashion program that we Clothed.</p>

            <ul class="question"><span>2016</span>
                 <li class="answer">
                <p>In 2016 we focused our attention on children using a concept James Mitchell nine-year-old daughter helped him develop. James purchased a pair of white canvas sneaker to wear with an outfit, but once the shoe became wore Leila asked to paint them. </p>
                <p>That very idea became Young Future First Flagship program. In July Young Futures develop a relationship with the Albany Barn, and with their support, we were able to invite over 25 children and families to come paint sneakers.</p> <p> The Albany Barn was so pleased with the work and excitement they asked Young Futures to come back to co-facilitate an education art gallery called “Summer in the City” We gave children bookbag that they painted and watched a documentary about growing up in the urban community. After we watched the documentary we had ice cream that was provided by Ben and Jerry’s. Through the winter Young Futures hosted small pop up art classes until the spring of 2017</p>

                 <li class="answer">
                     <p>In February Young Futures was contacted by Catholic Charities Church program Sunnyside Center in Troy NY. They were looking for an after school program to be facilitated with some of the at-risk children they were serving, They needed a program that was run once a week, and would engage not just their children but their parents as well. So we created our second flagship program call Art Evolution. The children would create various type of arts and we would document them, and allow them to speak on camera about their experience. </p> <p>This program challenges the children to create the rule that they would police, it also tasks with different children every week to lead their peers. Over the course of two months, the children were able to make candles, soap, and decorated a 12-inch cake using fondant and icing. At the end of the program Young Futures was rewarded, the same children that didn’t want to listen and participate the first week now wanted to know when we would be back! </p> <p>
                     On August we facilitated an art competition using the concept of Art & Sole, we welcomed 18 of the capital district hottest artist and ask them to design a pair of white canvas sneakers. After two hours they were judged and we announced the winner two weeks later where we auctioned the sneakers. Allowing us to pay the artist a percentage of their winners and raising funds for future children art programming.</p><p>
                     Based on our previous relationship the barn we all was able to come back to the table to discuss a partnership. Young Futures was asked to host a weekly class in Arbor Hill, which is still running today</p>

                             <p>This year programming focused on our weekly art class called Urban Art, the children made jelly soap, regular soap, candles, T-shirt pillows, custom marble coffee mugs, beaded bracelets, necklaces, sneakers, decorated cakes, and much much more. We also were about to facilitate another flagship program in February, we hosted our second annual Children Paint and Sip. This programmed welcomed 50 children, we offered the children Chocolate and strawberry milk using almond milk and 2% milk. We also had organic and No high fructose corn syrup beverages for them. This class was guided by a local artist Julan Talyor.</p>
                             <p>We continue to use our community partnership and collaborated with Ben and Jerry’s to provide the children attending their shop for free ice cream with a canvas that had an outline of an ice cream cone. On this day we gave away over 50 small canvas </p>
                             <p>Then in August, we hosted our second annual Art & Sole Competition</p>
