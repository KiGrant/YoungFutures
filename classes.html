            <p>Urban Art is an initiative that Young Futures created to address the strong need to expose, educate, and promote a love for art to our inner-city youth.
            </p>
            <p>The program gives kids an opportunity to share a first-hand account through pictures and videos of their growth and development as they explore the world of art and personal expression.
            </p>
            <p>Each of the projects below enables the kids in our Urban Art program to experience art on a different level—tapping into our children’s creative side and allowing them to explore what art means to them is the most important thing we can bring to the table.

                <span>A Night of Yoga</span>
                <li class="answer">
                    <p>Kids in our community learn about the delicate art of yoga and its many forms. A trained professional introduces kids to the beginning stages of yoga while keeping a watchful eye over each child to help them appreciate this form of art. Yoga has no age or ability restriction, making it a perfect match to help our kids empower themselves.</p>

                <li class="answer">
                    <p>This project blends the art of aromatherapy with the art of candle making. Our instructor educates the kids about the benefits of aromatherapy and the art of how to make candles using scents they pick or create. As the kids explore this form of art, we teach them the skills to educate other on this artform, allowing them to use art to empower others.</p>

                    <p>We use this project to show our kids that we can incorporate art into everyday products, encouraging them to become creators. Kids create their own soap—picking the color, picking molds, picking the scents, and carving their designs out of the soaps.</p>
